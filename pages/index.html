                          <p>
                            Medicare Part B recipients pay a monthly Part B premium. The price of the Part B premium is
                            dependent on the your annual income (as indicated on your individual or joint tax return).
                            The standard Part B premium amount in 2025 is $185. Most people pay the standard Part B
                            premium amount however if your modified adjusted gross income as reported on your IRS tax
                            return from 2 years ago is above a certain amount, you’ll pay the standard premium amount
                            and an Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA). IRMAA is an extra charge added to
                            your premium. Also, it’s important to know that there is a deductible that individuals are
                            required to pay before Medicare begins to pay their share of all services covered by
                            Medicare Part B. After the deductible is paid, recipients pay 20% of what Medicare deems to
                            be a “reasonable charge” while Medicare pays the remaining 80%. In 2025, the deductible
                            amount is $257.
