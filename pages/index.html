                                Medicare Part B recipients pay a monthly Part B premium. The price of the Part B premium
                                is dependent on the your annual income (as indicated on your individual or joint tax
                                return). The standard Part B premium amount in 2025 is $185. Most people pay the
                                standard Part B premium amount however if your modified adjusted gross income as
                                reported on your IRS tax return from 2 years ago is above a certain amount, you’ll pay
                                the standard premium amount and an Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA).
                                IRMAA is an extra charge added to your premium. Also, it’s important to know that there
                                is a deductible that individuals are required to pay before Medicare begins to pay their
                                share of all services covered by Medicare Part B. After the deductible is paid,
